// Chaotic Hyperbolic Entropy Divergence Oscillator (CHEDO) v2
// Logic:
// 1. Hyperbolic Curvature: Uses tanh(rolling_mean(ln(abs_ret * v + sqrt(...)))) to map returns to hyperbolic space.
// 2. Lyapunov Proxy: Measures sensitivity to initial conditions (chaos) via log diffs.
// 3. Entropy: Measures disorder via histogram probability or variability.
// Fusion: Weighted sum squashed by sigmoid to -1..1.

// Relativistic Quantum-Zeta Oscillator (RQZO)
// Logic:
// 1. Lorentz Factor: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) where v is price velocity.
// 2. Riemann Zeta: Summation of harmonics modulated by time dilation (tau = t/gamma).
// 3. Output: Oscillates based on "Market Energy" rather than just price.

--- FROM: New note 1 (5).txt (Apex Vector v4.1) ---
// Apex Vector [Flux + Efficiency]
// Logic:
// 1. Efficiency: Body Length / Range Length.
// 2. Volume Flux: (Volume / AvgVolume) * Direction.
// 3. Vector = Efficiency * Flux.
// 4. Superconductor States: Flux > 0.6 (Super Bull), Flux < -0.6 (Super Bear).

--- FROM: New note 1.6.txt (Apex Trend & Liquidity SMC) ---
// Apex Trend & Liquidity Master (SMC) v7.2
// Logic:
// 1. HMA Trend: Hull Moving Average formulation (Weighted Moving Average variant).
// 2. BOS (Break of Structure): Pivot Highs and Lows acting as liquidity levels.
// 3. Trend Cloud: Visual fill between Price and HMA.
