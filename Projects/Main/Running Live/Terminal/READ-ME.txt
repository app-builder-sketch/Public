OVERVIEW
--------
The Titan Terminal is a high-performance financial analytics dashboard built with 
Python and Streamlit. It integrates "God Mode" technical indicators, AI-powered 
market analysis, and social broadcasting capabilities into a single "Dark Pool" 
aesthetic interface.

It is designed for traders who need real-time multi-asset intelligence (Stocks, 
Crypto, Forex, Commodities) without switching between multiple apps.
